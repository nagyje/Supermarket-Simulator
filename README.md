# Supermarket-Simulator
Project for Data Structures at East Tennessee State University

This project was designed to introduce me to GUI, interfaces, and provide practice with more complex ideas
than a usual course project. The task was to create a simulation of a supermarket checkout area by any method 
we chose. The requirements specified that I was to manage the checkout traffic flow by opening/closing registers 
based on the lengths of the existing lines. Each customer was to have their own cart of priced items, which would be used
in the statistics tracking at the bottom of the GUI. Several stats were monitored including sales, customer throughput, 
and maximum line length. 


My code is in the SimulationLogic/Models folder, and the interfaces were provided to us by the instructor.
